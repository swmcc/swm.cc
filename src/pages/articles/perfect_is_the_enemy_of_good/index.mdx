In the realm of productivity and creativity, we often find ourselves battling against an invisible adversary—perfection. While the pursuit of flawlessness may seem noble, it often thwarts progress and stifles innovation. This is an underlying theme that you'll discern from my recent bout of activity on <Link href="/projects/pulp">pulp</Link>. I am the first to admit that my recent work isn't pristine, nor is it something I would showcase on a professional stage. Yet, on a personal level, the importance of "getting things done" far outweighs the quest for perfection.

This is not to say that I devalue quality or craftsmanship. Rather, I subscribe to the mantra, "Make it work, make it right, make it fast." This approach has become a cornerstone of my work-life cycle. However, sometimes, the priority becomes simply to make things work.

Embracing the idea of 'good enough' allows us to get into the rhythm of consistent action, a principle that is evident in my recent contributions. The plan is not to abandon these initial drafts, but to revisit them and iterate, refining them gradually over time. This iterative process allows for constant learning and improvement, something that a single-minded pursuit of perfection often prevents.

The philosophy of building in public may draw criticism from some quarters. There's a prevailing perception that anything less than polished, perfected work is a disservice to one's audience. I respectfully disagree.

Consider the phenomenon of open-source software as an example. Projects such as Linux, Python, or WordPress weren't immaculate upon their inception. They started as rudimentary frameworks that evolved over time, enriched by contributions from a global community of developers. The open-source movement showcases the beauty of an iterative process that values progress over perfection. It embodies the principle that creation, even if imperfect, is a critical step towards innovation and improvement.

Building in public, much like open-source development, invites scrutiny, feedback, and often criticism. Yet, it also fosters collaboration, learning, and, most importantly, progress. By exposing our works-in-progress, we not only progress faster but also inspire others to take their first steps, knowing that perfection isn't a prerequisite for contribution.

Consider the alternative. How many potential creators are stifled by the fear of not being perfect? How many brilliant ideas never see the light of day because their originators are too afraid to take the first step, fearing public criticism or perceived failure? This is where the old saying, "doing something is better than throwing rocks from the sidelines," comes into play.

Perfection is the enemy of the good because it is often unattainable and can lead to stagnation. The desire to be perfect can create unnecessary pressure, leading to inaction due to the fear of failure. On the other hand, 'good' is achievable and promotes progress. It encourages us to take the first step, learn from our experiences, and improve over time.

My recent flurry of activity may not be perfect, but it represents progress, learning, and a commitment to continuous improvement. It stands as a testament to the power of 'doing' over 'perfecting,' and hopefully, it serves as an inspiration to others who might be hesitating on the precipice of creation due to the intimidating shadow of perfection.

The pursuit of perfection should not paralyse. Instead, we should strive for continuous improvement, knowing that each step we take, however imperfect, brings us closer to our goals. After all, 'good' can lead to 'better,' and eventually, we may find that 'better' is indeed 'perfect' in its own unique way.
