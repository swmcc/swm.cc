Having an online presence has become a necessity. Whether it is for personal
branding or showcasing one's work, having a website can provide many benefits.
As a developer, I understand the importance of having a platform where I can
share my work and communicate with the community. That's why I started working
on my personal homepage as an open source
[project](https://github.com/swmcc/swm.cc).

<Image src={swmcc_1} alt="My first screenshot example" />

My personal homepage is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a
React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) applications.
Next.js offers many advantages, such as faster loading times, improved SEO, and
a better user experience. I also chose to host my website on
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a platform that specializes in deploying Next.js
applications.

<Image src={swmcc_vercel} alt="Vercel screenshot example" />

One of the main purposes of my personal homepage is to share updates on my other
personal [projects](http://swm.cc/projects). I have many ideas and projects that
I work on outside of my day job. However, I realised that keeping track of all
of these projects and sharing updates on them can be challenging. That's why I
decided to create a central [hub](https://github.com/users/swmcc/projects/6)
where I can share information about all of my personal projects.

<Image src={swmcc_2} alt="My Second screenshot example" />

In addition to sharing [updates](https://changelog.swm.cc), I also use my
personal homepage to publish [articles](https://swm.cc/articles) about topics that interest me. As a
developer, I enjoy learning about new technologies and sharing my knowledge with
others. Writing articles allows me to do both. I believe that sharing knowledge
is important, especially in the tech industry, where things are constantly
changing.

<Image src={swmcc_articles} alt="Articles screenshot example" />

While my personal homepage is still a work in progress, I am committed to
making it the best it can be. Currently, I am working on adding tests and
universal tooling to ensure that my code is maintainable and scalable. I
believe that testing is an essential part of software development, and I want
to make sure that my website is tested thoroughly.

<Image src={swmcc_issues} alt="Issues screenshot example" />

As an open source project, I welcome contributions from the community. Whether
it is a bug fix or a new feature, I believe that collaboration is key to
building great software. I encourage anyone who is interested in contributing
to my personal homepage to check out the repository on GitHub and get in touch
with me.
