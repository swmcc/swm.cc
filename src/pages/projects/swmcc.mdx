I decided on a new site and a new technology stack to go with it.
It's built using <a href="https://www.nextjs.org">Next.js</a> which
is new to me. I've always knew enough about the JS eco system to be dangerous.
However this time around I decided to jump in head first.

I decided on Next.js as it just seemed nice and anyone I knew that was 
using it was very happy with it. So I read more artciles on it, done a 
few tutorials and then decided to build something. I find that building
something and getting into a regular cadence of shipping will teach you 
ten fold what you'd learn on tutorials.

My first attempt looked like this:

It got me going and built up the momentum I needed. As I am not a designer
I always intended to use a template. Firstly it would look nicer than I could 
ever imagine doing. Secondly if I get an explicit one built on Next.js I will see
better design patterns and usage of Next.js and typescript.

So after a bit of researching I got myself a template and now it the site looks
like this:

I intend to add more features and pages to it as time goes on. This gives me a 
good base to build on. To see what I intend to do you can keep a view on the
