In a world where everyone seems to be jumping onto the latest web development
bandwagon, I decided to take a step back and start a links website. Why? Because
all the kool kidz have one, of course! But don't let the irony fool you; there's
a deeper reason behind this seemingly outdated project.

As a softwre engineer, most of my projects tend to utilise modern frameworks like
TailwindCSS, or they focus on complex backends that require little-to-no
frontend magic. While these tools and projects have their merit, I felt the need
to reconnect with the roots of web development â€“ good oul' HTML and CSS.

My decision to create a links website was not only inspired by the nostalgic
factor of belonging to the kool kidz club, but also by my desire to have a
project that would allow me to rediscover the beauty of vanilla markup and CSS.
By immersing myself in the simplicity of these foundational technologies, I aim
to enhance my understanding of the building blocks of the modern web and refine
my skills as a developer.

The concept of learning by doing is an essential part of my growth mindset. By
actively creating a project that focuses on pure HTML and CSS, I'm not only able
to put these skills to the test, but also gain a deeper appreciation for their
elegance and versatility. As a developer, it's crucial to stay adaptable and
never stop learning, and this links website is the perfect project to help me
achieve that.

Furthermore, by stripping away the complexities of modern frameworks and
libraries, I'm reminded of the importance of accessibility, performance, and
clean code. These are the principles that should always guide our work as
developers, regardless of the tools we use. With this links website, I have the
opportunity to build something that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also
adheres to these core values.

My decision to build a links website is an ironic yet purposeful
move to rediscover the wonders of pure HTML and CSS. By doing so, I hope to
strengthen my foundation as a web developer, reinforcing the importance of
accessible, performant, and clean code. In an era where developers are
constantly chasing the newest trends, sometimes it's essential to take a step
back and remember where it all began. After all, the kool kidz never forget
their roots.
