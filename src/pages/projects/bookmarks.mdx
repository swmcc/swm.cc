### Overview and History

Starting from a simple text file on a personal server in 2002, the "Bookmarks" project, a self-curated bookmark manager, has grown and evolved through several iterations, reboots, and even temporary cancellations in favor of third-party applications. As of 2023, it stands as my longest-running personal project.

### The Early Days

The Bookmarks project emerged from a necessity to save and access interesting online content both in and out of work. This need gave birth to a text file housed on a personal server. The process was straightforward: I would SSH into the server and add a link with a title, separated by '--' for easy reading via an SSH and Vim session. The simplicity and rustic charm of this solution sufficed for several years.

By 2006, the solution evolved into a command-line utility script, providing an easier method for appending the file and using a simple grep command for searching. The system was augmented with a few handy fgrep commands, adding timestamps and making it a more robust solution.

### Exploring Third-Party Solutions

The transition from a home-grown solution to a third-party bookmark manager came with the discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)">del.icio.us</a>. This platform served the purpose perfectly until Yahoo's unfortunate intervention a few years later. Disillusioned by this experience, I reverted to the command-line solution, this time enhanced with Perl commands and a Dropbox integration to make the bookmark list accessible across multiple devices/servers.

Subsequent trials with other bookmark managers like <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> and various other apps fell short of expectations. They were either too expensive, didn't align with my unique use case, or offered a free tier that was too clunky to be practical.

### Adapting to Change

By 2013, the Chrome sync function seemed to be the solution, providing an excellent bookmark management system until 2022. However, a shift in professional circumstances and a locked-down company laptop made the continuation of this method impossible. The reliance on a personalized bookmarking system had become so integral to my workflow that its absence significantly hampered productivity.

### Back to the Drawing Board

To regain control over my workflow, I decided to build a custom solution from scratch using Heroku and Rails. This platform, though rustic, was designed to cater to my specific needs. A basic Rails app was quickly set up on <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku's</a> free tier, augmented by a thin CLI command utility, as staying in the terminal was an important aspect of my user experience.

A gem that provided CRUD and search capabilities out of the box was employed for the web front-end. The solution worked perfectly until Heroku ended their free tier, coinciding with my desire to develop personal projects in public while maintaining good and standard development practices.

### The Current Iteration and the Future

The Bookmarks app underwent another transformation, integrating into the my <a href="https://github.com/swmcc/pulp">"Pulp"</a> app. As of 2023, the bookmarks have been successfully ported over, and a basic <a href="https://github.com/swmcc/bm">CLI</a> app has been developed to ensure usability in the work environment.

A slew of enhancements are in the pipeline, logged as <a href="http://github.com/swmcc/bm/issues">issues</a> to be addressed iteratively. I envision a public listing of shared links and other value-adding features, with a detailed roadmap soon to be outlined.

This project is a testament to the power of personal projects and the importance of tailored solutions. It stands as a continuously evolving tool that has adapted and grown along with my use cases, symbolizing two decades of learning, adaptation, and innovation.
