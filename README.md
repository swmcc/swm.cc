## Description

My web site. At the time of writing a work in progress.

I am building it publicly and will fill out this README as development
progresses.

I'm building this site using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and learning as I go, so if you see anything that could be improved, please let me know (via a PR or an Issue).


## Development Info

[Site](https://swmcc.vercel.app/)
